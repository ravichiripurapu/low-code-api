# lowcode

This application is used for low code platform.

## Project Structure


`/src/*` structure follows default Java structure.

- `/src/main/docker` - Docker configurations for the application and services that the application depends on

## Development

To start your application in the dev profile, run:

```
./mvnw
```

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the lowcode application for production, run:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify
```

To ensure everything worked, run:

```
java -jar target/*.jar
```

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

```
./mvnw -Pprod,war clean verify
```

## Testing

### Spring Boot tests

To launch your application's tests, run:

```
./mvnw verify
```

### Gatling

Performance tests are run by [Gatling][] and written in Scala. They're located in [src/test/java/gatling/simulations](src/test/java/gatling/simulations).

You can execute all Gatling tests with

```
./mvnw gatling:test
```

### Code quality using Sonar

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Note: we have turned off forced authentication redirect for UI in [src/main/docker/sonar.yml](src/main/docker/sonar.yml) for out of the box experience while trying out SonarQube, for real use cases turn it back on.

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the maven plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.login=admin -Dsonar.password=admin
```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```
./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar -Dsonar.login=admin -Dsonar.password=admin
```

Additionally, Instead of passing `sonar.password` and `sonar.login` as CLI arguments, these parameters can be configured from [sonar-project.properties](sonar-project.properties) as shown below:

```
sonar.login=admin
sonar.password=admin
```

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

### Docker Compose support


For example, to start required services in Docker containers, run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/services.yml up -d
```

To stop and remove the containers, run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/services.yml down
```

[Spring Docker Compose Integration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/features/dev-services.html) is enabled by default. It's possible to disable it in application.yml:

```yaml
spring:
  docker:
    compose:
      enabled: false
```

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a Docker image of your app by running:

```sh
npm run java:docker
```

Or build a arm64 Docker image when using an arm64 processor os like MacOS with M1 processor family running:

```sh
npm run java:docker:arm64
```

Then run:

```sh
docker compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```
